Hey so this is a very basic code to find "Prime numbers" within 2 given inputs using Sieve of Eratosthenes

How it works:

Efficiently marks non-prime numbers using the sieve algorithm
Counts and displays all primes between any two numbers (regardless of order)
Outputs total prime count

Just enter two numbers when prompted â€” the program will do the rest.
